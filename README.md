# CineMatch
CineMatch is a movie recommendation engine that moves beyond simple genre-matching to identify latent behavioral connections between films. By combining FAISS-based vector search for broad retrieval with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) reranker, the system uncovers movies that feel similar to users even when metadata suggests otherwise
